# LocalQuest - A Localhost Rec Room custom server ðŸ™€
## What's localquest?
LocalQuest is a custom server for rec room!! People can use this instead of RebornRec (it doesn't currently support every RebornRec build)!?
I kind of rushed this server a little bit ðŸ˜­ don't judge too much

## how to setup?
You should just be able to build and run [|=3]

## want to use a fork?

- Fork [LocalQuest-Data](https://github.com/Epic-Quest/LocalQuest-Data)
- To change the url you can either:
  - Change the BaseURL in NetworkFiles.cs to the raw files for your repo
  - Start the server with --URL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{YOUR-REPO}
- (When modifying LocalQuest-Data, skip over rooms 100-200 since they're reserved for RROs)
